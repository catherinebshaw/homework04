# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Overview

Test your coding knowledge with this quick multiple-choice quiz. You have one minute to complete the quiz and each time you enter a wrong answer, 10 seconds will be taken from the clock. If you can beat the clock, capture your initials and your time remaining in the highscore area. 

Just click the start button to begin. When the begin button is clicked, a timer starts counting down from 60 and the first question appears on screen under the title "Question". There are three multiple-choice questions in the quiz. Once an answer is selected, the correct answer will appear in the box below the question. If an incorrect answer is chosen, 10 seconds is removed from the timer. If the questions are answered before the timer runs out, the user can enter their initials and score, or time left, in the prompts.  Highscore appears below the timer.
